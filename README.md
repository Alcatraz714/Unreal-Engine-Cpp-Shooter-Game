# Unreal-Engine-Cpp-Shooter-Game
## Weâ€™re excited to announce that Unreal Engine 4.27 is now available! This release offers something for everyone, from filmmakers and broadcasters, through visualization specialists in architecture, automotive, and product design, to game developers and beyond. Here are just some of the major highlights.  


## Next-level in-camera VFX
With this release, in-camera VFX is no longer just something to aspire to. A slew of improvements to the efficiency, quality, and ease-of-use of the toolset mean that this game-changing virtual production technique is now far more attainable. Many of these enhancements also have applications in other industries, especially broadcast and live events.
